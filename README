This application was designed to initialize a raisls 3.2 application
with custom gemfiles customizations, and additional templates that you would
have to add manually. This application was created for those who are tired of having to do the usual modification of the .gitignore, adding :test, :development groups for RSPEC and Cucumber/Capybara, and anything else that I usually use in my working environment. "

This version includes
	- RSPEC installs and configures properly
	- TODO: .gitignore
	- TODO: .HAML / SASS as default
	- TODO: .layout changed to HAML
	- TODO: Other additions that I can't think of right now :P
